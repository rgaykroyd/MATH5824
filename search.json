    "text": "4.1 Overview\nIn Section 1.3 we described a general statistical model with a response variable \\(y\\) and an explanatory variable \\(x\\). We observe \\(y_i\\) at each location \\(x_i,\\) for \\(i=1,\\ldots, n\\). We imagined that the \\(y\\)’s are noisy versions of a smooth function of \\(t\\), say \\(f(\\cdot)\\) where the errors follow a normal distribution with constant variance. That is \\[\ny_i = f(x_i) + \\epsilon_i, \\quad\n\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathrm{N}(0,\\sigma^2),\n\\] for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\), where \\(f\\) is smooth, the \\(\\epsilon_i\\) are i.i.d., and \\(f\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are unknown.\nThe log-likelihood for this situation is: \\[\nl(f; \\mathbf{y})\n= -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - f(x_i)\\right)^2 - n \\log \\sigma\n\\tag{4.1}\\] and we wish to estimate \\(f\\) for a given data set \\(\\mathbf{y}=\\{y_1,\\dots, y_n\\}\\). With no constraints on \\(f\\), the log-likelihood would be maximized by setting \\(f(x_i)=y_i\\) for all \\(i\\), and we would estimate the noise variance as \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=0\\). This takes no account of randomness in the data and \\(f\\) would in general need to be quite wiggly to achieve this fit.\nFigure 4.1 (a) shows such an interpolation of noisy data.

We would rather trade-off goodness-of-fit against smoothness of \\(f\\). Figure 4.1 (b) shows a smoothing spline fit to the same data. This is much better as there is a clear explanation of the relationship, it could be used reasonably well for interpolation and prediction."

In Figure 4.2 (a) the fit is essentially a straight line, perhaps Figure 4.2 (b) and Figure 4.2 (c) show acceptable fits.

Then, \\(\\hat{f}\\) solves the interpolation problem for the artificial data set \\((x_i,\\hat{y}_i), i=1,\\dots , n\\). That is, \\(\\hat{f}\\) minimizes \\(J_\\nu(f)\\) over functions \\(f\\) satisfying \\(\\hat f(x_i)=\\hat{y}_i\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\). Consequently, \\(\\hat{f}\\) is a \\(p^{\\text{th}}\\)-order natural spline, where \\(p=2\\nu-1\\). This means that, when solving the smoothing problem, we only need consider spline functions given by the representations in Proposition 3.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Smoothing spline of data shown as dots and with fitted values shown as crosses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Interpolating spline of fitted values from smoothing problem\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Illustration of proposition showing that solution of the smothing problem is a natural interpolating spline.\n\n\nProof: Suppose the assertion is not true. In this case, we must be able to find a function \\({\\hat{f}^\\star}\\), say, which also interpolates the artificial data \\((x_i,\\hat{y}_i), i=1,\\dots ,n\\), but which has a smaller roughness penalty. That is \\[\nJ_\\nu({\\hat{f}^\\star}) &lt; J_\\nu(\\hat{f})\n  \\mbox{ with }\n\\hat{f}^\\star(x_i) = \\hat{y}_i, \\ i=1,\\ldots,n.\n\\] Note that the fitted values from the function \\(\\hat f^\\star\\) are also equal to \\(\\hat y_i, i=1,\\dots,n\\) as it interpolates the same artificial data as \\(\\hat f\\).\nNow, from Equation 4.2, \\[\\begin{align*}\n  R_\\nu(\\hat{f}^\\star, \\lambda) &= \\sum_i (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda J_\\nu(\\hat{f}^\\star)\\\\\n&&lt; \\sum_i (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda J_\\nu(\\hat{f})\n= R_\\nu(\\hat{f}, \\lambda).\n\\end{align*}\\] Hence \\(R_\\nu(\\hat{f}^\\star, \\lambda) &lt; R_\\nu(\\hat{f}, \\lambda)\\). But, by construction \\(\\hat{f}\\) minimizes \\(R_\\nu(f, \\lambda),\\) which is a contradiction. Hence, it must not be possible to find a function \\({\\hat{f}^\\star}\\) which also interpolates the artificial data but which has a smaller roughness penalty.\nWe have shown that \\(\\hat{f}\\) is the optimal interpolant of the fitted values \\(\\hat{y}_i,\\ i=1,\\dots,n,\\) so it follows from Proposition 4.1 that \\(\\hat{f}\\) is a natural spline of order \\(p=2\\nu-1\\)."

Further, I intend to set-aside some lecture time for us to discuss selected exercises. For the second, an additional computer session has been added, in Week 5 (26 February - 1 March), this is 3 weeks before the assessed practice in Week 8 (18 - 22 March). Further, a few new instructional videos will be available addressing some RStudio topics.

However, we still just use linear functions of the predictor variables. A further extension of the linear model is the generalised additive model. Here, we no longer insist on the predictor variables affecting the response via a linear function of the predictors, but allow the response to depend on a more general smooth function of the predictor. In the Level 5 component of this module, we study splines and their use in interpolating and smoothing the effects of explanatory variables in the generalised linear models of the Level 3 component of this module (see separate Lecture Notes accompanying MATH3823). Towards the end of the material, we will learn that the fitting of generalised additive models is a straightforward extension of what is learnt in MATH3823.\nOutline of the additional material in MATH5824 compared to MATH3823:\n\nInterpolating and smoothing splines.\nCross-validation and fitting splines to data.\nThe generalised additive model."

Clearly, the residual variance is largest for the constant-depth model in Figure 1.1 (a), and smallest for the cubic polynomial in Figure 1.1 (c) – the residual sums of squares are: 6252.5, 5773.05, 4489.84, 4242.89. However, none of these models produces a convincingly good fit. Moreover, these models are not particularly believable, since we know that geological pressures exerted over very long periods of time cause the landscape and its underlying layers of rock to undulate and fracture. This suggests we need a different strategy.\nNext, consider the simulated example in Figure 1.2. At first look we might be happy with the fitted curves in Figure 1.2 (a) or Figure 1.2 (b). The data, however, are created with a change-point at \\(x=0.67\\) where the relationship changes from linear with slope \\(0.6\\) to a constant value of \\(0.75\\). This description is completely lost with these two models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Linear model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Quadratic model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Piecewise linear model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Cubic smoothing spline\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Simulated data superimposed with predictions from various models.\n\n\nFigure 1.2 (c) shows the result of fitting one linear function to the data below \\(0.67\\) and a second linear function above. Clearly, this fits well but it has assumed that the change-point location is known – which is unrealistic. Finally, Figure 1.2 (d) shows a fitted cubic smoothing spline to the data – we will studies these models later. This shows an excellent fit and leads to appropriate conclusions. That is, the relationship is approximately linear for small values, then there is a rapid increase, and finally a near constant value for high values. Of course, this is not exactly as the true relationship with a discontinuity at \\(x=0.67\\) but it would definitely suggest something extreme occurs between about \\(0.6\\) to \\(0.7\\). Full details will follow later, but the cubic spline fits local cubic polynomials which are constrained to create a continuous curve.\nNow returning to the coal seam data. Figure 1.3 shows the data again, superimposed with predictions from methods which are not constrained to produce such smooth curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Constant interpolating spline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Linear interpolating spline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Cubic interpolating spline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Cubic smoothing spline\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The coal-seam data superimposed with predictions from various spline models.\n\n\nThe simplest method, constant-spline interpolation, assumes that the dependent variable remains constant between successive observations, with the result shown in Figure 1.3 (a). However, the discontinuities in this model make it quite unreliable. A better method, whose results are shown in Figure 1.3 (b), is linear-spline interpolation, which fits a straight line between successive observations. Even so, this method produces discontinuities in the gradient at each data point. A better method still, shown in Figure 1.3 (c), is cubic spline interpolation, which fits a cubic polynomial between successive data points such that both the gradient and the curvature at each data point is continuous.\nA feature of all these interpolation methods is that they fit the data exactly. Is this a good thing? The final method assumes that there may be some measurement error in the observations, which justifies fitting a smoother cubic spline than the cubic interpolating spline, but as we see in Figure 1.3 (d) which does not reproduce the data points exactly. Is this a bad thing? We will see during this module how to construct and evaluate these curves. Here, the results are presented only for motivation."

    "text": "1.3 General modelling approaches\nWe wish to model the dependence of a response variable \\(y\\) on an explanatory variable \\(x\\), where \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are both continuous. We observe \\(y_i\\) at each time \\(x_i,\\) for \\(i=1,\\ldots, n\\), where the observation locations are ordered: \\(x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \\ldots &lt;x_n\\). We imagine that the \\(y\\)’s are noisy versions of a smooth function of \\(x\\), say \\(f(x)\\). That is, \\[\ny_i = f(x_i) + \\epsilon_i,\n\\tag{1.1}\\] where the \\(\\{\\epsilon_i\\}\\) are i.i.d: \\[\n\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathrm{N}(0,\\sigma^2).\n\\tag{1.2}\\] We suppose we do not know the correct form of function \\(f\\): how can we estimate it?\nIt is useful to divide modelling approaches into two broad types: parametric and non-parametric.\n\nParametric models\nBy far the most common parametric model is simple linear regression, for example, \\(f(x) = \\alpha + \\beta x\\), where parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are to be estimated. This is, of course, the simplest example of the polynomial model family, \\(f(x) = \\alpha + \\beta x + \\gamma x^2 +\\cdots + \\omega \\; x^p\\), where \\(p\\) is the order of the polynomial and where all of \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\dots, \\omega\\) are to be estimated. This has as special cases: quadratic, cubic, quartic, and quintic polynomials models. Also common are exponential models, for example \\(f(x) = \\alpha e^{-\\beta x}\\), where \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) are to be estimated – do not confuse this with the exponential probability density function.\nNote that the polynomial models are all linear functions of the parameters. They are standard forms in regression modelling, as studied in MATH3714 (Linear regression and Robustness) and MATH3823 (Generalised linear models). The exponential model, however, is an example of a model which is non-linearly in the parameters – it is an example of a non-linear regression model.\nAlthough very many parametric models exist, they are all somewhat inflexible in their description of \\(f\\). They cannot accommodate arbitrary fluctuations in \\(f(x)\\) over \\(x\\) because they contain only a small number of parameters (degrees-of-freedom).\n\n\nNon-parametric models\nIn such models, \\(f\\) is assumed to be a smooth function of \\(x\\), but otherwise we do not know what \\(f\\) looks like. A smooth function \\(f\\) is such that \\(f(x_i)\\) is close to \\(f(x_j)\\) whenever \\(x_i\\) is close to \\(x_j\\). To characterise and fit \\(f\\) we will use an approach based on splines. In practice, different approaches to characterizing and fitting smooth \\(f\\) lead to similar fits to the data. The spline approach fits neatly with normal and generalised linear models (NLMs and GLMs), but so do other approaches (for example, kernel smoothing and wavelets). Methods of fitting \\(f\\) based on kernel smoothing and the Nadaraya–Watson estimator are studied in the Level 5 component of MATH5714 (Linear regression, robustness and smoothing) where the choice of bandwidth in kernel methods is analogous to the choice of smoothing parameter value in spline smoothing.\n\n\nPiecewise polynomial models\nA common problem with low-order polynomials is that they can often fit well for part of the data but have unappealing features elsewhere. For example, although none of the models in Figure 1.1 fit the data at all well, we might imagine that three short linear segments might be a good fit to the coal-seam data. Also, the piecewise linear model was a good description of the data in Figure 1.2 (c). This suggests that local polynomial models might be useful. In some situation, for example when we know that the function \\(f\\) is continuous, jumps in the fitted model, as in Figure 1.2 (c), are unacceptable. Alternatively, we may require differentiability of \\(f\\). Such technical issues lead to the use of splines, which is introduced in the next chapter."

At the knots, however, \\(f\\) might not be continuous and it might not be differentiable – in such cases we would say that the function is not smooth.\nTo ensure that \\(f\\) is also smooth at each of the knots, we impose smoothness constraints which control continuity of the function and its derivatives at the knots.\nLet \\(f^{(\\ell)}\\) be the \\(\\ell\\)-th order derivative, with \\(f^{(0)}=f\\) being the function itself, \\(f^{(1)}=f'\\) is the first derivative and \\(f^{(2)}=f''\\) the second derivative. Further, let \\(f^{(\\ell)}(t-\\epsilon)\\) and \\(f^{(\\ell)}(t+\\epsilon)\\), for \\(\\epsilon\\ge 0\\), denote evaluation of the function or its derivative at points just below and just above \\(t\\) – we will be interested in their relative values as \\(\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0\\).\nTo impose smoothness, we require that\n\\[\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(\\ell)}(t_k-\\epsilon)\n=\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(\\ell)}(t_k+\\epsilon),\n\\tag{2.2}\\] for all \\(k=1,\\ldots,m\\) and for \\(\\ell = 0,\\ldots,(p-1)\\).\nIn other words we say that \\(f\\) is smooth if the limits, from below and from above, of the function and its \\((p-1)\\) derivatives exist and are equal.\nThe meaning of these smoothness constraints is illustrated in Figure 2.2. In Figure 2.2 (a), a piecewise cubic function with two knots has been plotted. The first derivative, \\(f'\\), is discontinuous at the first knot and the function itself, \\(f\\), is discontinuous at the second knot. Figure 2.2 (b) shows a similar shaped cubic spline with two knots. This time, the function \\(f\\) and its first two derivatives are continuous at both knots.\nThe smoothness conditions in Equation 2.2 induce constraints on the coefficients \\(\\{a_{k\\ell}\\}\\). A polynomial of order \\(p\\) has \\(p+1\\) coefficients, and there are \\(m+1\\) intervals when we have \\(m\\) knots. This leads to \\((p+1)\\times(m+1)\\) coefficients but there are \\(p\\) constraints at each of the \\(m\\) knots. Thus the total degrees of freedom of the system is \\[\n\\text{df}_{\\text{spline}}   = (p+1)(m+1) - pm = m+p+1.\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nThese degrees of freedom provide the necessary flexibility in the spline.\nNote that \\(f\\) is infinitely differentiable everywhere, except at the knots where it is \\(p-1\\) times differentiable. In particular, for \\(p=1\\), \\(f\\) is a linear spline comprising linear pieces constrained to be continuous at the knots, although the slope of \\(f\\) is discontinuous at the knots. Also, for \\(p=3\\), \\(f\\) is a cubic spline comprising cubic polynomial pieces continuous at the knots; where the first and second derivatives of \\(f\\) are also continuous, but the third derivative is discontinuous at the knots."

Thus we have natural linear splines (\\(p=1\\)), natural cubic splines (\\(p=3\\)), etc. A spline is said to be natural if, beyond the boundary knots \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_{m}\\), its \\((p+1)/2\\) higher-order derivatives are zero: \\[\nf^{(j)}(t) = 0,  \n\\tag{3.1}\\] for \\(j={(p+1)}/{2},\\ldots,p\\) and either \\(t \\leq t_1\\) or \\(t \\geq t_m\\).\nThus a natural spline of order \\(p\\) has the following \\(p+1\\) constraints, in addition to those of Equation 2.2 : \\[\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(\\ell)}(t_1-\\epsilon)\n=\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(\\ell)}(t_m+\\epsilon) =0,\n\\tag{3.2}\\] for \\(\\ell={(p+1)}/{2},\\ldots,p\\).\nIn particular,\n\na natural linear spline has \\(p+1=2\\) additional constraints: \\[\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(1)}(t_1-\\epsilon)\n=\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(1)}(t_m+\\epsilon) =0,\n\\tag{3.3}\\] implying that \\(f(t)\\) is constant in the outer intervals of a natural linear spline,\na natural cubic spline has \\(p+1=4\\) additional constraints: \\[\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(2)}(t_1-\\epsilon) = \\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(2)}(t_m+\\epsilon) =0,\n\\] \\[\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(3)}(t_1-\\epsilon) = \\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(3)}(t_m+\\epsilon) =0,\n\\tag{3.4}\\] implying that \\(f(t)\\) is linear in the outer intervals of a natural cubic spline.\n\nThe total degrees of freedom of a natural spline is, starting from Equation 2.3, but taking into account the additional \\(p+1\\) additional constraints is \\[\n\\text{df}_{\\text{nat.spline}} = m+p+1 - (p+1) = m.\n\\tag{3.5}\\] That is the degrees of freedom for natural splines equals \\(m\\) whatever the value of \\(p\\).\n\nProposition 3.1 Linear and cubic natural splines have the following representations:\n\nLinear natural splines: \\[\nf(t) = a_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^m b_i \\left| t - t_i \\right|;  \\quad  \\sum_{i=1}^m b_i = 0\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\nCubic natural splines: \\[\nf(t) = a_0 + a_1 t + \\sum_{i=1}^m b_i \\left| t - t_i \\right|^3;  \\quad  \\sum_{i=1}^m b_i = \\sum_{i=1}^m b_i t_i = 0.\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\n\n\nProof: Not covered here (but may be included later in the module if time allows)."

    "section": "3.4 Roughness penalties",
    "text": "3.4 Roughness penalties\nAn aim of spline models is to describe an unknown function using piecewise-polynomials which are smooth. In the previous section, smoothness was imposed by explicitly constraining specified high-order derivatives. An alternative approach is to measure and control the degree of smoothness of the splines. In practice the roughness of the spline is usually measured and one definition of roughness is: \\[\nJ_\\nu(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left[ f^{(\\nu)}(t) \\right]^2 \\text{d}t\n\\tag{3.8}\\] where \\(\\nu\\geq 1\\) is an integer and \\(f^{(\\nu)}\\) denotes the \\(\\nu\\)th derivative of \\(f\\). Thus \\(f^{(1)}(t)\\) denotes the first derivative and \\(f^{(2)}(t)\\) denotes the second derivative of \\(f\\).\nIntuitively, roughness measures the “wiggliness” of a function.\nAim might be to find the smoothest function which interpolates the data points. Hence, an alternative approach to that in previous sections is to find the function \\(f\\) which minimizes Equation 3.8 and satisfies \\(f(t_i)=y_i\\) for \\(i=1,\\dots,m\\). We refer to the solutions of this problem as the optimal interpolating function.\nIt turns out that there is a very close link between \\(J_\\nu(\\cdot)\\) and \\(p\\)th-order natural splines, where \\(p=2\\nu-1\\) (so \\(p\\) is odd). Important special cases are: \\(\\nu=1\\) and \\(p=1\\), and \\(\\nu=2\\) and \\(p=3\\). This relationship is defined in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 3.2 The optimal interpolating function is a \\(p\\)th-order natural spline, where \\(p = 2ν − 1\\). That is, the natural spline \\(f\\) is the unique minimizer of \\(J_\\nu(f)\\).\n\nProof: Not covered here (but may be included later in the module if time allows).\nComments\n\nLinear and cubic interpolating splines are also of interest in numerical analysis, for example to interpolate tables of numbers.\nThe linear interpolating spline is simply the piecewise-linear path connecting the data points.\nOf course, in the linear spline case, knot points are clearly visible as kinks in the interpolating function. But, in the cubic spline case, knots points are invisible to the naked eye. Hence, in general, there is little motivation to use higher-order splines.\nNumerical considerations: the interpolating spline solutions involve matrix inversion. The inversion of an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix involves \\(O(n^3)\\) operations – hence it is time consuming if \\(n\\) is large (for example, \\(n=1000\\) or \\(10000\\)). Fortunately there are tricks to reduce the computation to \\(O(n)\\)."
